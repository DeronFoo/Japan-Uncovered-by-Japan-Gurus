                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>
                    The third-largest and southernmost of Japan's four major islands is Kyushu. East China Sea to the west and the Pacific Ocean to the east form its borders. Its name alludes to the nine prehistoric districts (kuni) that the island was previously divided into. The Ryukyu archipelago, which stretches out for around 700 miles (1,100 km) to the southwest of the main island, as well as surrounding islands, make up Kyushu, the country's southernmost chih (region).<br><br>
                    Kyushu is divided from the island of Honshu to the north by the Shimonoseki Strait and from Korea to the northwest by the Tsushima Strait, often known as the Eastern Channel. A intricate network of volcanic mountains make up the island. The southern climate is subtropical, and Kyushu is renowned for its subtropical vegetation and copious rains. It is home to Mount Aso, the biggest active volcanic crater in the world, as well as Aso-Kuju, Kirishima-Yaku, and Unzen-Amakusa national parks. Beppu is a well-known hot springs destination.

                    <h2>Fukuoka City</h2>
                    <p>
                        Kyushu's largest city and one of the ten most populous cities in Japan is Fukuoka. Fukuoka has long been a significant harbour city and, in the 13th century, the Mongol invasion forces chose it as the location of their landing due to its proximity to the Asian mainland (it is closer to Seoul than to Tokyo).<br><br>
                        The port city of Hakata and the former castle town of Fukuoka were combined to become the city of Fukuoka in the year 1889, giving rise to the Fukuoka of today. One of Fukuoka's key districts and the primary train station are still known by the name Hakata.

                    <h2>Mount Aso</h2>
                    <p>
                        In 2021 and 2016, Mount Aso, an active volcano in the heart of Kyushu, most recently erupted. With a radius of more than 100 kilometres and a diameter of up to 25 kilometres, Aso's ancient caldera is one of the largest in the world. The mountain's active volcanic summits, notably Mount Nakadake, whose breathtaking crater is reachable by tourists, are located in the caldera's centre.<br><br>
                        However, keep in mind that due to toxic volcanic fumes, severe weather, or the possibility of volcanic activity, the crater region is frequently only partially and occasionally entirely blocked off to tourists. Therefore, be sure to research the volcano's status before visiting. People with respiratory conditions should avoid going close to the crater even when the area around the summit is open because of the powerful fumes that can be present there.

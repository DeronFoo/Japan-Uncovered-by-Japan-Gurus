                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>        
                    The Tohoku Region (東北地方, Tōhoku Chihō, literally "North East Region") comprises six prefectures located in the northern part of Honshu, Japan's largest island. The area is famous for its scenic countryside, mountains, lakes, hot springs, high-quality rice, and harsh winters.<br><br>
                    However, the Tohoku Region was severely affected by the earthquake and tsunami that occurred on March 11, 2011, as well as the subsequent nuclear accident. Among the destinations mentioned in our travel guide, only Sendai, Matsushima, Iwaki, and the Sanriku Coast experienced direct damage from the earthquake and tsunami. Despite this, most of the attractions in these areas reopened within a few weeks or months.

                    <h2>Aomori Nebuta Festival</h2>
                    <p>
                        Every night of the Aomori Nebuta Festival, the floats are taken out onto the streets of downtown Aomori for a parade. The parade is held in the evening, except on the last day (August 7), when it takes place in the afternoon. The floats are pushed along the street by human power, with the people weaving back and forth and spinning around for the spectators. Each float is accompanied by teams of taiko drummers, flute and hand cymbals players, as well as hundreds of dancers called haneto, who follow the procession chanting "Rassera, Rassera" while performing a dance that resembles skipping.<br><br>
                        The parade route, which is nearly three kilometers long, has plenty of free seating on the ground, as well as reserved seats that can be purchased from Ticket Pia and convenience stores. People are encouraged to participate in the parade, and visitors come from all over to join in the dancing.

                    <h2>Hiraizumi</h2>
                    <p>
                        During the Heian period, the Fujiwara clan was the most powerful in Japan, and in 1105 they selected Hiraizumi as the seat of their "Northern branch". The city grew in political power and cultural refinement, to the point of being considered a rival to Kyoto, the national capital.<br><br> 
                        However, in 1189, Hiraizumi was destroyed by Minamoto Yoritomo, who was searching for his brother Yoshitsune, and who had found refuge with the local Fujiwara leader. Although the city never regained its former prominence, it still contains some of the Tohoku Region's most valuable historic and cultural assets

                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p>In summary, Tohoku region is an important agricultural area, producing rice, vegetables, and fruits, as well as seafood from the Pacific Ocean and the Sea of Japan. The region was heavily affected by the 2011 earthquake and tsunami, which caused significant damage and loss of life. However, the Tohoku region has made significant progress in its recovery efforts and continues to be a popular tourist destination in Japan.</p>

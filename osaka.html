                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>
                    After Tokyo, Osaka (大阪, Ōsaka) is the second-largest metropolitan region in Japan. For many centuries, it has served as the Kansai Region's economic engine. Naniwa was the previous name for Osaka. Naniwa was previously Japan's capital city, the first one ever known, before the Nara Period, when it was transferred with the rule of each new monarch.<br><br>
                    Osaka was the location of Toyotomi Hideyoshi's castle in the 16th century, and if Tokugawa Ieyasu hadn't ended the Toyotomi bloodline following Hideyoshi's passing and founded his government in far-off Edo, the city may have turned into Japan's political centre (Tokyo).

                    <h2>Osaka Castle</h2>
                    <p>
                        On the site of the Ishiyama Honganji Temple, which had been demolished by Oda Nobunaga thirteen years previously, Osaka Castle (大阪城, Ōsakajō) was constructed in 1583. The castle tower's current ferro-concrete rebuild was constructed in 1931. It remarkably survived the city-wide air strikes during the war. In 1997, extensive renovations gave the castle a fresh look. Inside, the castle tower has been completely modernised, and there is even an elevator for more convenient access. It has an educational exhibit on Toyotomi Hideyoshi and the history of the castle.<br><br>
                        The auxiliary citadels, gates, turrets, towering stone walls, and moats that encircle the castle tower add additional defence. The ancient "western citadel" that now makes up the Nishinomaru Area is a grass garden with 600 cherry trees, a tea shop, the old Osaka Guest House, and lovely views of the castle tower from below. The garden charges an entrance fee, in contrast to the majority of the other castle grounds.

                <h2>Osaka Aquarium Kaiyukan</h2>
                <p>
                    One of Japan's most magnificent aquariums, Osaka Aquarium Kaiyukan (海遊館, Kaiyūkan), is situated in the Tempozan Harbor Village in Osaka's bay region. It exposes several species of life that live around the Pacific Rim in an impressively well-organized manner.<br><br>
                    More than a dozen tanks, each displaying marine life from a different part of the Pacific Rim, are on show. The whale shark, as the aquarium's major draw, is housed in the nine-meter-deep centre tank, which represents the Pacific Ocean.

                    <h2>Summary</h2>
                    <p>
                        In short, Osaka is a must-visit destination for multiple types of tourists. Being addressed as “food lovers' paradise”, Osaka is not only consisting of various historical sites, but also thousands of traditional cuisines such as Okonomiyaki, Kitsune Udon, Teppanyaki and others. If historical sites and food hunting are not your cup of tea, there are theme parks in Osaka also such as Universal Studios.

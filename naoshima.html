            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                Naoshima (直島) is a Japanese island in the Seto Inland Sea notable for its modern art museums, architecture, and sculptures. The island, which is part of Kagawa Prefecture, is a pleasant vacation from Japan's vast urban centres, with its Mediterranean ambience, sandy beaches, and sunny weather, paired with a laid-back, rural character.<br><br>
                The Benesse Corporation, which maintains art museums, installations, and sculptures on Naoshima and neighbouring islands, placed much of the island's art. The well-known Japanese architect Ando Tadao created Benesse's museums, which comprise the Chichu Art Museum, the Lee Ufan Museum, and all of the Benesse House's structures. Furthermore, Ishii Kazuhiro, a contemporary architect, designed Naoshima's municipal buildings and schools. The Setouchi Triennale art event takes place on the island.

            <h2>Honmura</h2>
            <p>
                Honmura (本村) is a tiny port town on Naoshima's eastern coast that is home to the Art House Project, a collection of abandoned homes, a temple, and a shrine that have been turned into art installations and contemporary art venues by Japanese and international artists. The art homes are distributed across the city, and the majority of them appear unassuming from the street, fitting in with the surrounding traditional Japanese neighbourhood. The interiors of each, on the other hand, have been left to artists to transform into anything they see fit.

                <h2>Benesse House</h2>
                <p>
                    On Naoshima Island, the Benesse House is a modern art museum and vacation hotel. The complex is the focal point of the Benesse Corporation's art facilities on the island, and it comprises of four structures created by famous architect Ando Tadao: the Museum, Oval, Park, and Beach. Each structure has its own distinct artworks and guest rooms.<br><br>
                    In addition to the art in the museum and the guest rooms, there are approximately twenty art works on the lawns and beaches around the Benesse House, including the iconic pumpkin (a reconstructed pumpkin is currently on exhibit after the original was damaged in a 2021 typhoon). Many of these may be located along the coastline and cliffs below the museum and have been specially constructed to blend in with their environment.
